## Description

The Team Summary Generator makes use of the inquirer node module to prompt the user on the command-line to enter information about each member of the team.  The user will first be prompted to provide the Team Manager's info.  Then, the user can choose to add an Engineer, an Intern, or finish by choosing Done. Upon completing the prompts, the app will create a "team.html" file in the output folder.  The html file created is responsive and mobile friendly using Bootstrap and custom styling.  The info for each employee will appear in a card, starting with the Manager, then all the Engineers, and finally, the Interns no matter what order the Engineers or Interns are added.
